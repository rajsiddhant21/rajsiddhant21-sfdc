    In my job as a Salesforce developer, I start each day by planning my tasks and checking messages.Then, I spend most of my day writing code for different business needs and talking with the business and analysts to make sure I understand what they want.If something isn't possible technically or time limitation, I figure out a way around it. I also help my team members with any problems they're having and review their work.I spend time learning and reading about Salesforce development and developer guide.I attend meetings with my team to discuss progress and plans.At the end of the day, I review what I've done, update my progress, and get ready for the next day, always staying flexible and ready for changes.
